- [ ] If the timetable or stops format changed, I re-generated `src/__e2e__/timetable/stops.bin` and `src/__e2e__/timetable/timetable.bin` based on the latest Swiss GTFS for the next Monday (and adjusted e2e tests results accordingly if needed).
- [ ] I ran the performance tests and confirmed that no regression was introduced.
